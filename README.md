# SimpleGit

A lightweight educational version control system built with Python and PyQt6.

---

# Project Overview

SimpleGit is a simplified graphical version control system inspired by Git.

The purpose of the project is to:
- learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- understand version control concepts
- practice GUI development
- practice file system management
- collaborate as a software team

This is NOT intended to replace Git.

Instead, it is a learning-focused snapshot management system.

---

# Run The App

```powershell
python main.py
```

If dependencies are missing:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Build A Shareable Windows EXE

The project includes `build.ps1`, which:

- installs requirements
- creates `assets/icon.ico` from `icon.png`
- builds `dist/SimpleGit.exe`
- copies the executable to `website/downloads/SimpleGit.exe`

Run:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

The website can be opened at:

```txt
website/index.html
```

# Repository Structure

When a project is initialized:

```txt
MyProject/
│
├── project files
│
└── .simplegit/
    │
    ├── snapshots/
    │   ├── s1/
    │   ├── s2/
    │   └── s3/
    │
    ├── timeline/
    │   └── main.json
    │
    ├── HEAD.json
    ├── config.json
    └── ignore.txt
```

---

# Folder Purpose

## snapshots/

Stores complete copies of project states.

Each snapshot contains:
- project file copies
- metadata

Example:

```txt
s1/
│
├── files/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── app.py
│
└── meta.json
```

---

## timeline/

Stores timeline history.

Example:

```json
{
  "timeline_name": "main",
  "snapshots": [
    "s1",
    "s2",
    "s3"
  ]
}
```

---

## HEAD.json

Tracks current snapshot position.

Example:

```json
{
  "current_snapshot": "s3"
}
```

---

## config.json

Stores repository configuration.

Example:

```json
{
  "repo_name": "MyProject",
  "created_at": "2026-05-13"
}
```

---

## ignore.txt

Functions similarly to `.gitignore`.

Contains folders/files to skip.

Example:

```txt
node_modules
__pycache__
.venv
dist
build
```

---

# Main Commands

Although the application is GUI-first, these internal command concepts exist.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `simplegit init` | Initialize repository |
| `simplegit snapshot` | Save project state |
| `simplegit timeline` | Show snapshot history |
| `simplegit backward` | Restore previous snapshot |
| `simplegit forward` | Restore next snapshot |

---

# Core Design Philosophy

SimpleGit uses:

## Full Snapshot Storage

Every snapshot stores:
- complete project copies

Advantages:
- easier implementation
- easier restoration
- simpler OOP structure
- easier debugging

Disadvantages:
- more storage usage

This tradeoff is acceptable for educational purposes.

# Snapshot System

## Snapshot Creation Flow

```txt
User clicks Snapshot
    ↓
Enter snapshot message
    ↓
Generate snapshot ID
    ↓
Copy project files
    ↓
Save metadata
    ↓
Update timeline
    ↓
Update HEAD
```

---

# Snapshot Metadata

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "s3",
  "message": "Added login UI",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-13 14:22",
  "parent": "s2"
}
```

---

# Navigation System

SimpleGit currently supports:
- single timeline only

Navigation works similarly to:
- undo/redo systems

---

## Backward

Moves to previous snapshot.

Process:
1. Find previous snapshot
2. Delete current project files
3. Restore files from target snapshot
4. Update HEAD

---

## Forward

Moves to next snapshot.

Process:
1. Find next snapshot
2. Delete current project files
3. Restore snapshot files
4. Update HEAD

---

# Important Safety Rule

The `.simplegit/` folder MUST NEVER be copied into snapshots.

Otherwise recursive snapshot copying occurs.

---

# GUI Architecture

The GUI layer MUST remain separate from core logic.

GUI should:
- call methods
- display results
- show dialogs

GUI should NOT:
- directly manipulate repository files

---

# Application Architecture

The project follows a simplified MVC-style architecture.

# Snapshot Restoration Rules

When restoring:
- current working files are removed
- snapshot files are copied back
- `.simplegit/` remains untouched

---

# Ignored Files

Ignored paths are read from:

```txt
.simplegit/ignore.txt
```

Ignored folders/files should not be:
- copied
- restored
- tracked

---

# Development Phases

# Phase 1 — Core Repository

Goals:
- initialize repository
- load repository
- basic file structure

---

# Phase 2 — Snapshot System

Goals:
- create snapshots
- restore snapshots
- metadata system

---

# Phase 3 — Navigation

Goals:
- backward navigation
- forward navigation
- HEAD tracking

---

# Phase 4 — GUI Integration

Goals:
- connect buttons
- dialogs
- timeline list
- project explorer

---

# Phase 5 — Polishing

Goals:
- error handling
- confirmations
- improved UI
- cleanup

---

# Team Collaboration Rules

## Rule 1

Core logic and GUI should remain separate.

---

## Rule 2

Do not hardcode paths.

Use:
- pathlib
- utility functions

---

## Rule 3

Every major feature should have:
- dedicated class
- clear responsibility

---

## Rule 4

Avoid placing business logic inside GUI files.

---

## Rule 5

Use descriptive method names.

GOOD:

```python
create_snapshot()
```

BAD:

```python
doStuff()
```

---

# Coding Style

## Naming

| Type | Style |
|---|---|
| Classes | PascalCase |
| Functions | snake_case |
| Variables | snake_case |
| Constants | UPPER_CASE |

---

# Example

```python
class SnapshotManager:
    pass
```

---

# Error Handling

The application should handle:
- invalid repositories
- missing snapshots
- permission errors
- file conflicts
- restore failures

Gracefully using dialogs/messages.

---

# Future Improvements

Possible advanced improvements:
- snapshot compression
- deduplication
- graph visualization
- diff algorithms
- multi-timeline support

---

# Project Goal

The primary goal of SimpleGit is educational value.

The project focuses on:
- software architecture
- OOP design
- filesystem management
- GUI application structure
- teamwork and collaboration
